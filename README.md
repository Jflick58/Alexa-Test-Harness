# Alexa-Test-Harness
Test your Alexa skills quickly and easily using Python and Pytest

# Information 

Very much a work in progress. I built DepressionAI, and then discovered there wasn't any real test frameworks out there for testing Alexa skills. So I decided to build one. 

### Vision: 
Simple package for testing Alexa skills.

### Roadmap: 

- Ingestion of intent schema and generate intent response tests from that.
- Utterance-Intent matching tests
- Machine learning-based utterance generation
- Multithreaded execution
- Documentation and examples
- Pytest hooks
