# Alexa-Test-Harness
Test your Alexa skills quickly and easily using Python and Pytest

# Information 

Very much a work in progress. I built DepressionAI, and then discovered there wasn't any real test frameworks out there for testing Alexa skills. So I decided to build one. 

### Vision: 
Simple function call to add automated tests to your Alexa skills. 

### Roadmap: 

- Automatic ingestion of intent schema and generate basic tests from that. 
- Utterance-Intent matching tests
- Async execution
- Documentation and examples
